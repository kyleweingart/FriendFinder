# Friend Finder Application

## Description

*Friend Finder* is a compatability based friend finding app. The user responds to a set of ten questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The app takes in results from the user surveys and then compares the answers with those from other users to find the best overall friend match. The app then displays the name and picture of the best overall match. 

The application is built using a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server on the back end and the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework on the front end.
